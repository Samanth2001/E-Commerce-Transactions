# Data Science (eCommerce-Transactions Dataset)

This project involves:

1.Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

2.Building a Lookalike Model to recommend similar customers.

3.Conducting Customer Segmentation using clustering techniques.

Tasks

Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualized transaction patterns, revenue, customer spending, and product performance.
Identified key business insights using matplotlib and seaborn.

Task 2: Lookalike Model:
Built a model to recommend 3 similar customers based on their purchase behavior.
Used cosine similarity and saved recommendations in Lookalike.csv.

Task 3: Customer Segmentation:
Applied KMeans clustering to group customers.
Evaluated clusters using Davies-Bouldin Index and Silhouette Score.
Visualized customer clusters.

Technologies Used:
Python Programming Language
Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
    
Output Files
Lookalike.csv: Contains customer recommendations with similarity scores.
